# FFT Hardware written in BSV.

**_NOTE_**: This codebase uses MIT's lab2 harness from 6.375 as it's base.

This codebase contains FFT hardware models written in Bluespec System Verilog. You may build verilog by using the Bluespec compiler (linked below).

## Prerequisites
1. Text Editor
2. Bluespec Compiler - https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc/releases/tag/2024.01

Steps to build verilog:

```shell
make verilog
```

If you need help with using this code elsewhere, too bad.
